            Project: Project on EV Cars

=============================================================
=============================================================
In this project is based on EV Cars, I have got the EV car data from Gov.data. It had several information about Electric Vehicles, like car model, car make, year make, electric range. The data was also world wide, so that you can get an overall idea about EV cars all over the world. It had several information those are not helpful for the analysis like ID, so I deleted those informartion, but some variables were related to consumers like purchaser's age, gender, so that you will have an idea from the analysis about the buyer of the EV cars.
